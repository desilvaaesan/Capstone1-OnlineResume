<h1>My Hobbies: More Than Just Code!</h1>
<p>Hey there! When I’m not coding or working on cool projects, you’ll probably find me doing one of these:</p>
<h2>🏸 Badminton</h2>
<p>A sport that keeps me on my toes (literally). Whether it’s smashing, diving, or just trying not to miss the shuttle, badminton is my go-to way to stay active. I play on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and yes, I take it seriously, but still have fun!</p>
<hr>
<h2>🏃 Running</h2>
<p>I started running to improve my stamina and endurance, and now it’s a regular part of my routine. I’m currently pushing myself for longer distances, and I even signed up for a 12km marathon! My goal? Finish strong and not collapse halfway through. 😂</p>
<hr>
<h2>🏀 Basketball</h2>
<p>Nothing beats a good game of basketball with friends. It’s not just about shooting hoops—it’s about strategy, teamwork, and that one clutch three-pointer that makes you feel like an NBA star for five seconds.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🖥️ Tech & Coding</h2>
<p>Okay, I know this is obvious, but I actually enjoy learning new technologies, solving problems, and building things. Whether it’s front-end, back-end, or something in between, I love diving into new frameworks and becoming a better developer every day.</p>
<hr>
<h3>🎮 Gaming</h3>
<p>From competitive shooters to MOBA, gaming is my way to unwind. It’s also lowkey problem-solving, but with better graphics and less debugging (sometimes).</p>
<hr>
<h3>🍔 Trying New Food</h3>
<p>I have a love-hate relationship with food. I want to eat healthy, but burgers, street food, and sweets keep calling my name. I enjoy exploring different flavors, especially when it involves a late-night snack run.</p>
<hr>
<h4>What About You?</h4>
<p>If you relate to any of these (or have suggestions for a new hobby I should try), <a href="./contact.html">let’s talk!</a> Always up for <strong>learning, competing, or just having a good time.</strong> 😆</p>
